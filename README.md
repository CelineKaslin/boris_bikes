# Boris Bikes #

We are living in London, people love to cycle and demand access to bikes to aid
get them through their dangerous journeys to work and wobbly rides home on Friday nights.

The Mayor's Office comes up with a plan, to unleash a fleet of Boris Bikes onto
the streets. Boris commands Transport for London (TFL) to deliver his plan.

To implement the Mayor's ambitious plans, TFL come up with a plan: a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. Lacking in resources to build a program that emulates all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on), they requested that our team write software to achieve this, and make Boris' grand ambitions a reality.
